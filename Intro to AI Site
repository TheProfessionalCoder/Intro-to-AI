            <h2>About AI</h2>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines
                that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It encompasses various
                techniques such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer
                vision, and more. AI aims to enable computers to perform tasks that normally
                require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making,
                understanding natural language, and recognizing patterns.
